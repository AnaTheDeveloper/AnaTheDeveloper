<!-- Introduction  -->

I am a hardworking self-taught developer, and graduate, with a strong foundation in software programming concepts.

I have consolidated my foundation by creating projects, attending boot camps, gaining hands on experience and continuing on with my self learning. Creating a working program from scratch using only knowledge and initiative really drives me to produce the best work I  can. Some of these projects are highlighted below. These experiences mean I now have a strong awareness of the difference between front end development and backend development, and how they interact.
